What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Both are used to merge branches. Merge combines all the commits on a feature branch to the master branch. This command also preserves the history of the
master branch. Rebase completely overwrites the master branch. There will be no history saved when this command is run.



What is a remote repository?

Remote repositories are versions of the project that are hosted on the Internet or somewhere else on the network.
